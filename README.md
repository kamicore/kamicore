# KamiCore

**KamiCore** is a modular core for building content-driven systems and web services.

It is designed as a minimal, predictable foundation with a strong focus on:
- explicit architecture
- plugin-first extensibility
- multi-domain and multi-language setups
- performance and long-term maintainability

> KamiCore is not a traditional CMS.
> A CMS is only one of the possible use cases.

## Project status

🚧 **Design & architecture phase**

This repository is the canonical home of the KamiCore project.

At this stage it contains:
- project vision and roadmap
- architectural direction and core principles
- brand assets and identity guidelines

Source code will be published once the core architecture and concepts are stabilized.

## Core principles

- minimal core, no monolith
- explicit data flow instead of hidden magic
- plugins instead of built-in features
- predictable behavior over convenience
- performance as a first-class concern
